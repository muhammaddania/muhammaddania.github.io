Hello! I'm **Muhammad Danial**, a student at **Islamia College University Peshawar**, currently in the **4th semester**.

This website is created as part of an assignment for the **Human Resource Management (HRM)** course, given by **Sir Inam Ul Haq**.

The purpose of this blog is to explore how websites can be used for personal branding and learning reflections, and to fulfill academic requirements in a creative, hands-on way.

Stay tuned for more posts!
